Post Mortem For Later Review:

I'm essentially done with this project, a few bugs remain, however I think it's best to leave them and come back later to learn from them. It was a fun project to make but I'm going to move onto other ones. If you're reading this I'm surprised you've managed to find this repository, very obscure and random program from an amateur programmer haha.

In design it was not entirely specified what parts of the code handled what for combat, which led to a lot of spaghetti code and headaches getting it to work. The Node based system for the story elements were good but some sort of JSON or GUI option for creation of Nodes would have been good.

Certain errors can occur in character creation when you input the wrong kind of type, never investigated this bug but it happened multiple times during playtests so I'd assume it's a type conversion error. 

In the demo I ran out of time to make use of the AsciiRenderer (which has it's own set of problems) but it could be a fun addition. 

The Story Branch and Node Classes I think are quite good however the Node class gets a bit cluttered and unclean due to the large amount of nested for/if blocks, I'd definitely have written more of it into functions if I could go back.

Overall this is most definitely not the cleanest code I've ever written but it was a growth experience and I enjoyed writing it. 

Thanks for Reading! (If you're not me)
